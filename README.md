# Probabilistic-Convergence-Paradox
This program is Monte Carlo simulation to determine the probability that two people with have the same birthdays, even in a small group of people. The simulation performs several probabilistic experiments to determine the percentages for groups of different sizes. We are running multiple random trials to understand the likely outcomes of each simulation.
